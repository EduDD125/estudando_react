# üìö Estudando React

Welcome to the **Estudando React** repository! This repository is dedicated to learning and mastering the React framework, a powerful JavaScript library used for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces for web applications.

## üéØ Objectives

The primary goals of this repository are:

1. **Understand Core Concepts**: Deep dive into React‚Äôs core concepts such as components, JSX, props, state, and lifecycle methods.
2. **Hands-on Practice**: Implement practical exercises and small projects to reinforce the understanding of React principles.
3. **Explore Advanced Topics**: Cover advanced topics like React Hooks, Context API, performance optimization, and integrating with other libraries.
4. **Build Projects**: Apply learned concepts by building real-world projects, including single-page applications (SPA) and multi-page web apps.
5. **Best Practices**: Learn and apply best practices for structuring React projects, writing clean and maintainable code, and leveraging tools like ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies and Tools

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router**: For handling routing in SPAs.
- **Redux/Context API**: For state management.
- **TypeScript**: To add type safety to the code.
- **Jest/React Testing Library**: For unit testing components.
- **Webpack/Babel**: To bundle and transpile the code.
- **ESLint/Prettier**: For code linting and formatting.
- **Styled-Components**: For styling React components.

## üìÇ Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **\`/src\`**: Contains the source code for all projects and exercises.
  - **\`/components\`**: Reusable components.
  - **\`/pages\`**: Page components for different routes.
  - **\`/hooks\`**: Custom React Hooks.
  - **\`/context\`**: Context providers for global state management.
  - **\`/assets\`**: Static assets like images and icons.
- **\`/tests\`**: Contains unit and integration tests for components and hooks.
- **\`/docs\`**: Documentation and guides for using the repository.
- **\`/examples\`**: Sample projects and mini-apps demonstrating specific React features.
